## User Story ##

As a User, I want to see a navbar on the website
WHEN I search for a job title in a city, and a enter a home with a certain number of bedrooms and bathrooms,
THEN I will see cards populated on the screen with all the relavent information.

## User Guide ##
Once user opens the app, they will be presented with a home page and navbar. The navbar will have placeholder text to guide the user for what value they should search.
